```

## Introduction
### Carbon storage
Siri?

### Carbon fluxes (Joseph)

- Ecosystem respiration (ER)
- Gross ecosystem production (GEP)
- Net ecosystem exchange (NEE)
- Light response curve (we will not do any here but I think it is important to introduce what it is and why we use them)


## Field measurements
Joseph will first demonstrate how the setup works and what is what.
Then he will move from group to group to measure NEE and ER at each of the sites.
The students will do the measurements themselves.
